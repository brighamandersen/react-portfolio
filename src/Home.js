      Hi, my name is <strong>Brigham Andersen</strong>. I'm a student at Brigham
      Young University getting a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science:
      Software Engineering and minoring in Business.
      <br />
      <br />
      I love solving the problem we hate most -- wasting time and money.
      <br />
      This passion drives my career, centered on using technology to boost
      business productivity.
      <br />
      I'm addicted to giving my all and am looking forward to combining that passion with my skills in software engineering and business to
      help you!
