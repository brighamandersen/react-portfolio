NOTE - Deprecated December 2023 ([See latest portfolio repo](https://github.com/brighambandersen/portfolio))

This was my portfolio website for a good while. This was written in React which was perfect at the time since that was what I was learning at my job and I wanted to practice. However, my portfolio site was static, so it wasn't a good use case for React. So I went in and converted it to just HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript. Since the code was so different I put that code in my [`portfolio`](https://github.com/brighambandersen/portfolio) repo and then took my old react website and renamed it to be the [`react-portfolio`](https://github.com/brighambandersen/react-portfolio) website.
